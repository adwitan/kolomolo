# Kolomolo Java Test - Part 1

**1. Can you tell me what annoys you in Java SpringBoot the most? What features would you like to have in Java SpringBoot that you don't have now?**

   One of the aspects in Java SpringBoot that can sometimes be frustrating is the complexity involved in configuring certain aspects of the application, especially when dealing with intricate dependencies or advanced features. I'd like to see even simpler configuration options in Java SpringBoot. While it's powerful, sometimes configuring it can feel overly complex.

**2. How would you go about creating a Java service on the cloud? Specify steps and explain why.**

   To create a Java service on the cloud, I'd typically start by selecting a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or GCP based on requirements. Once I've selected the service, I will set up networking components such as virtual networks, subnets, and security groups to ensure proper communication and security. Then, deploy Java application to the cloud. After deploying application, I will set up monitoring and logging to track performance and troubleshoot issues.
   Additionally, I will implement features like autoscaling and load balancing to ensure service can handle fluctuations in traffic and maintain high availability.


**3. Do you know any other ways of configuring Java SprintBoot apps but the application context file? Why would you use them? What are the benefits?**

* Environment Variables: You can use environment variables to configure your Spring Boot application. This approach is useful when deploying applications to different environments like development, staging, and production, as it allows you to externalize configuration details without modifying the application code. Environment variables are also commonly used in containerized environments like Docker or Kubernetes.
* Command-Line Arguments: Spring Boot allows you to pass configuration properties via command-line arguments when running the application. This method is convenient for overriding default settings during application startup, providing flexibility in configuration without the need to modify configuration files.
* Profiles: Spring Boot supports the concept of profiles, which allows you to define different sets of configuration properties for different environments or use cases. Profiles can be activated based on various conditions such as environment variables, system properties, or the presence of specific configuration files. Using profiles enables you to maintain separate configurations for development, testing, and production environments within the same codebase.

**4. Did you work with any enterprise solutions and if yes - tell me more about this experience?**

I develop web application from scratch for Polish telecommunications operator
and digital service provider. Application aims to implement a unified IT system supporting
new and consistent business processes on the areas of sales, marketing, service and
billing using Event Sourcing, CQRS, Microservices.


**5.Explain your process for debugging errors in your Java code. What debugging techniques do you find most effective? How do you approach identifying the root cause of an error? Do you have any preferred tools or strategies for debugging complex issues?**

In debugging errors, I always start by understanding the context of the issue. I strive to learn when, how, and in what situation the error occurred. Then, I meticulously examine the logs and correlate the application code with the logs to verify the correctness of the application's behavior. In my current project, which comprises around 60 microservices with an event-driven architecture, pinpointing the cause of an error can often be time-consuming. From my experience working on such large projects, I believe that precise log analysis is paramount.



**6. How do you write clean and maintainable Java code? What coding conventions or best practices do you follow? How do you document your code for better understanding by others? Describe your strategies for ensuring code readability and maintainability over time.**

I follow standard coding conventions.
Stick to SOLID principles and use design patterns appropriately.
I believe that well-written code should be self-documenting. However, in cases where the complexity of a problem may hinder understanding, I create documentation and strive to describe the code with meaningful comments.
I prioritize readability and believe that shorter, more complex code is not always better because it can consume a lot of time for someone analyzing it, especially in the context of debugging or issue resolution.

**7. Explain your approach to testing your Java code. What types of tests do you typically write (e.g., unit tests, integration tests)? How do you ensure your tests cover various functionalities and edge cases? Do you utilize any testing frameworks or tools?**

In my programming practice, I mostly write unit and integration tests. To ensure effective testing, I strive to provide a large number of test data to cover various scenarios, including the most unusual ones. This approach helps me ensure that my code functions correctly even in unexpected situations and meets all the specified functional and non-functional requirements. Mainly I use Junit, Mockito, Spring Boot Test, AssertJ.

**8. Describe a situation where you got stuck on a Java problem. How did you approach it? What troubleshooting steps did you take? Did you seek help from others, or what resources did you utilize? How did this experience influence your problem-solving approach?**

I can't describe a specific situation related to Java, but I always start by analyzing the problem. I set a specific time frame to work on it and gather all necessary information. I don't dwell on the problem indefinitely and believe that everyone has a different perspective, so someone might provide a valuable hint or insight. I often discuss problems and possible solutions with colleagues.

**9. Describe a scenario where you implemented a design pattern in a Java project. Which pattern did you use, and why was it the most suitable choice? Explain the problem you were trying to solve. Discuss the benefits of using the chosen design pattern in that specific context. How did the design pattern improve the code structure, maintainability, or other aspects of the project?**

In mu current project, we have a highly complex microservice responsible for managing the shopping cart in an application that facilitates the sale of telecommunications services. To prevent difficulties in code readability and to shield against the exposure of much more complex code, we have implemented the Facade design pattern. Implementing the Facade design pattern has made the highly intricate microservice with complex logic and numerous operations much more readable.


**10. What experience do you have with AWS?**

I don't have commercial experience with AWS.
